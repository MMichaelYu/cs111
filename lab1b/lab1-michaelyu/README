Limitations:
The program simpsh runs as expected and the 10 test cases in test.sh all work.
The test cases test a variety of the options possible within simpsh. 

Right now simpsh only exits with 0 which signals a success or 1 which signals an error

The Makefile supports
make: to build the executable
make clean: to delete files created by the makefile
make dist: to create a .tar for submitting
make check: to runs test.sh which has 10 test cases for simpsh

An example command:
simpsh \
  --rdonly a \
  --pipe \
  --pipe \
  --creat --trunc --wronly c \
  --creat --append --wronly d \
  --command 3 5 6 tr A-Z a-z \
  --command 0 2 6 sort \
  --command 1 4 6 cat b - \
  --wait

Should output:
0 sort
0 cat b -
0 tr A-Z a-z
