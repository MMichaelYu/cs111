lab0
lab0.c
	Source code for a program that copies input from a file to an output
	file. Accepts command line arguments for --input=filename,
	--output=filename, --segfault, and --catch. 
	--input=filename will use filename as the standard input to copy from.
	--output=filename will create filename and copy standard input to there.
	--segfault will force a segmentation fault.
	--catch will find and report the segmentation fault.
Makefile
	default: builds the lab0 executable
	check: runs smoke-test
	test includes testing with valid input and output arguments
	     	      testing with an invalid input
		      testing with an invalid output
		      testing if a segmentation is actually forced
		      testing if --catch successfully reports a segmentation fault
	clean: deletes makefile-created files
	dist: builds the distribution tarball
stacktrace.png
	Running under gdb lab0 with --segfault forces a segmentation fault and a
	stack backtrace is shown.
nullpointer.png
	Running under gdb lab0 with --segfault, a breakpoint is set at the line
	where the segmentation fault is forced and the pointer is inspected to
	confirm it is NULL.
