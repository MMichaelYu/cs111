README:
	Contains basic information about this set of files.
lab3b.py:
	A python script to analyze 6 given csv files about an EXT2 File
	system and list any errors such as: unallocated blocks, duplicately
	allocated blocks, unallocated inodes, missing inodes, incorrect link
	counts, incorrect directory entries, and invalid block pointers.
Makefile:
	default: does nothing, use make run instead
	run: runs the python script lab3b.py
	clean: removes files created by the makefile/script
	dist: tars necessary files for submission
Problems:
My implementation was not tested extensively especially on indirect
blocks. There may be errors there when using different .csv files.
