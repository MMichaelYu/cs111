Michael Yu 704637121 Lab 4
README:
	Contains basic information about this set of files.
Makefile:
	default: compiles lab4_1, lab4_2, lab4_3
	clean: removes any files created by the Makefile
	dist: creates tarball for grading
lab4_1.log:
	Contains temperature readings and timestamps from the Edison board and
sensor for at least 60 seconds, every second.
lab4_2.log:
	Contains temperature readings, timestamps, and commands received from
the server. Temperature readings come from the sensor attached to the Edison
board.
lab4_3.log:
	Contains temperature readings, timestamps, and commands received from
the server. Temperature readings come from the sensor attached to the Edison
Board.
lab4_part1.c:
	Use Makefile command 'make' to compile into executable lab4_1. This
will use the Edison board and temperature sensor to log temperature recordings
in F every second into a file named lab4_1.log. Timestamps are included for
every reading. 
lab4_part2.c:
	Use Makefile command 'make' to compile into executable lab4_2. This
executable takes in a server and port number. For example './lab4_2
r01.cs.ucla.edu 16000'. It connects to that server and port and sends
temperature readings and my UID to that server using a thread. It also
receives and follows commands from that server using another thread. Commands
include START STOP OFF SCALE=C/F PERIOD=####. Temperature recordings,
timestamps, and command received from the server are logged into a file named
lab4_2.log.
lab4_part3.c:
	Use Makefile command 'make' to compile into executable lab4_3. This is
the same as lab4_part2.c's purpose but uses SSL/TLS to protect communications.
The logs are stored into a file named lab4_3.log.
TrustStore.pem:
	Certificate for verification. Not necessary for my implementation.
The server and port is not hardcoded in lab4_part2.c and lab4_2. However the
server and port is hardcoded in lab4_part3.c and lab4_3.
