Limitations:
Currently a segmentation fault occurs for test case 7 when running make check

Right now simpsh only exits with 0 which is a success or 1 which is an error

The Makefile supports
make: to build the executable
make clean: to delete files created by the makefile
make dist: to create a .tar for submitting
make check: to runs test.sh which has 10 test cases for simpsh
